## Narrations

1. Why we chose this project

   The topic of our project is actually not merely about financial crisis but I'd like to start with it. Speaking of financial crisis, the first words that come to our minds might be "risk", "bankrupt", "bubble", or "unemployment. But I want to add two more words here, one is "ubiquitous" while the other is "cyclical".

2. Why is our project interesting

   We all remember the 2008 great recession beginning with subprime mortgage bubble, but we had no idea how painful it is because we were in high school or something. Let's see what grown-ups had to say. Around half of the people with a salary over 100K and those between 30 and 44 said it had "a serious effect" on them. We are about to fall into these two categories.

3. Who is the audience

   You may think that financial crisis only concerns investors, but in fact, it concerns everyone present. We already see in the last slide that the 2008 financial crisis had "a serious effect" on around half of the people. If you earn money and are to manage them, you are definitely going to be influenced. Thus the audience is all dealing with money, the majority of which will be white-collar workers.

4. Why is our visualization important

   After receiving payments, other than spending them, we want to manage them. Among all these money management operations and choices, we will need guidelines to help us. In terms of stocks, we also have to decide whether to hold, sell, or buy. Trust me you don't want to buy them during a financial recession. 

5. How is our visualization useful
   Back in 1925, this Kondratiev observed that business cycles exist, each of which comprises of four phases. We are going to visualize historical data to match and prove these waves, and show the general patterns for our audience to explore. By doing so, this time, you can trust your own judgement and make your own decisions.
